**Authors:** Zhenbang Wu, Anant Dadu, Michael Nalls, Faraz Faghri, Jimeng Sun  

**Published at:** NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Spotlight)

## Note on Code and Dataset Release  

We are in the process of finalizing the **code** and **dataset** for this project:  

- **Code**: The codebase is being cleaned up and will be released in this repository soon.  
- **Dataset**: The **MIMIC-Instr** dataset will be hosted on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) once the preparation and review process is complete.  

Stay tuned for updates! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to open an issue or reach out via email.
